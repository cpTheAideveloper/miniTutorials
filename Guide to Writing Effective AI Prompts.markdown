## What Is a Prompt?

A prompt is the instruction or question you give an AI to get a response. Think of it like giving directions to a friend—you need to be clear about what you want and provide enough details to avoid confusion. A good prompt tells the AI exactly what to do and how to do it.

## Key Parts of a Great Prompt

To make your prompts effective, include these five key parts:

### 1. The Instruction (What to Do)
This is the main task you want the AI to perform. Be clear and specific about what you’re asking.

- **Example**: “Write a short story” is vague. Instead, try: “Write a 100-word story about a lost dog finding its way home.”
- **Tip**: Use action words like “write,” “list,” “explain,” or “create” to make the task obvious.

### 2. The Role (Who the AI Should Be)
Tell the AI to act like a specific person or expert to shape its response. This sets the tone and perspective.

- **Example**: “You are a friendly travel guide” or “You are a professional chef.”
- **Tip**: Choose a role that matches the task, like a teacher for explanations or a storyteller for creative writing.

### 3. Examples (Show What You Want)
If the task is complex, give one or two examples to show the AI the style or format you expect.

- **Example**: If you want a translation, include: “Example: English: I love books. Spanish: Amo los libros. Now translate: I enjoy music.”
- **Tip**: Keep examples short and directly related to the task.

### 4. Format (How to Present the Answer)
Specify how you want the response to look, like a list, paragraph, or table. This makes the output easier to use.

- **Example**: “List three benefits of recycling as bullet points” or “Write a one-sentence summary.”
- **Tip**: Be clear about the structure, like “Use a table with two columns” or “Keep it under 50 words.”

### 5. Extra Details (Background Info)
Add any important information the AI needs to understand the task fully. This helps avoid irrelevant answers.

- **Example**: “My audience is 10-year-old students” or “The setting is a futuristic city in 2050.”
- **Tip**: Only include details that are necessary for the task to keep the prompt focused.

## How to Put It All Together

Here’s a simple order to structure your prompt for clarity:

1. **Start with Extra Details**: Give background info first to set the context.
2. **Add Examples**: Show the AI what you expect, if needed.
3. **Set the Role**: Tell the AI who it should act as.
4. **Give the Instruction**: Clearly state the task.
5. **Specify the Format**: Explain how the response should look.

**Example Prompt**:
> **Extra Details**: I’m planning a trip to Paris in spring.  
> **Examples**: Example: Activity: Eiffel Tower visit. Description: Iconic landmark with stunning views.  
> **Role**: You are a friendly travel guide.  
> **Instruction**: Recommend three activities in Paris for first-time visitors.  
> **Format**: Present the response as a bullet-point list with each activity and a short description.

**Expected Output**:
- **Louvre Museum**: Explore world-famous art, including the Mona Lisa.
- **Eiffel Tower**: Visit this iconic landmark for breathtaking city views.
- **Seine River Cruise**: Enjoy a relaxing boat ride with scenic views of Paris.

## Tips for Better Prompts

1. **Keep It Simple**: Use clear, everyday words. Avoid vague phrases like “make it good.”
2. **Be Specific**: Instead of “Tell me about dogs,” try “Explain three traits of Golden Retrievers in simple terms.”
3. **Test and Tweak**: If the AI’s response isn’t what you wanted, rephrase your prompt or add more details.
4. **Stay Positive**: Say what to do (e.g., “Use a friendly tone”) instead of what not to do (e.g., “Don’t be boring”).
5. **Check the Length**: Short prompts work for simple tasks; longer ones are okay for complex tasks with examples or details.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Being Too Vague**: Unclear instructions lead to off-topic answers. Always state exactly what you want.
- **Overloading the Prompt**: Too many details or conflicting instructions can confuse the AI. Stick to what’s necessary.
- **Skipping the Format**: Without a format, the AI might give a response that’s hard to use. Always say how you want the answer presented.
- **Forgetting the Audience**: If the response is for a specific group (e.g., kids or experts), mention it in the prompt.

## Practice Makes Perfect

Writing great prompts takes practice, but it gets easier with time. Start with simple tasks, like asking the AI to list ideas or explain something. As you get comfortable, try more complex prompts with roles, examples, and specific formats. If something doesn’t work, tweak one part of the prompt and try again.

**Quick Practice**:
Write a prompt asking the AI to:
- Act as a science teacher.
- Explain why the sky is blue in two sentences.
- Use simple language for middle school students.
- Present the answer as a short paragraph.

Then, check the AI’s response and adjust your prompt if needed.

## Why This Matters

Clear prompts save time and get you better answers from AI. By using these steps—giving a clear instruction, setting a role, adding examples, specifying a format, and including extra details—you can make the AI work for you, whether you’re brainstorming, learning, or creating something new.

Happy prompting!
